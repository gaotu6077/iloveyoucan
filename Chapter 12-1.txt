A missing surfer in Australia is believed dead in a shark attack, police say - ABC News has confirmed.

Detective Superintendent Dave Thompson said the man was taken to the Royal Australian Mounted Police hospital with a life-threatening condition.

"He was taken to the Royal Australian Mounted Police Hospital with a life threatening condition after being struck by a shark on Saturday night," he said.

"At this time we can't confirm if this is a shark attack or whether the man is dead.

"We are still investigating the circumstances and we are not going to confirm if there is any shark attack."

The man - described as a 50-year-old man - was last seen near Pembrokeshire on Saturday.

A shark attack is an extremely rare occurrence, with the most common being in the Northern Territory.

The man is believed to have been in his early 20s on Saturday when he was struck by a shark.

The shark attacked him in the middle of the afternoon while he was swimming, Thompson said.

"We have had several incidents of sharks attack in the Northern Territory, but this is the first time we have had one from this shark attack, which is unprecedented," he said.

"It is a very unusual thing for a shark to get into a human being and then attack them."
