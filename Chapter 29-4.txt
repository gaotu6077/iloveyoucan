The case against Trump, which has been sealed, is the latest in a series of high-profile cases involving Trump and his associates. Since then, some of the cases have been brought by state attorneys general, some by judges and some by the federal government.

Some experts say the scope for a criminal prosecution could be enormous.

"The scope of this case is staggering," said Joseph Lieberman, a former federal prosecutor and special counsel on the Russia investigation, in a telephone interview. "It's unprecedented because it is unprecedented. It's a major international investigation, it's unprecedented."

The Justice Department had requested the Justice Department's cooperation in the case.
