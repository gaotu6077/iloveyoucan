"I'm excited about Josh Allen. I love him. He's a good person," Buffalo coach Rex Ryan said. "I've always been a big fan of him. He was a great teammate, but he was there to help us out. He was an unbelievable teammate. He was a great teammate and a good football player. He's going to be a big part of this team."

Allen will be an unrestricted free agent on Jan. 1, 2017, after the Bills re-signed him to a one-year, $4 million deal.
