Measles Outbreak: Cases In Texas Near 200 After Deceased Man In New Mexico Tested Positive - Forbes

A man who went viral after injecting an 8-oz can of Valium into his face was shot in the face in New Mexico, according to a report.

Dylan Lee of Phoenix, Ariz., has been battling a brain tumor for the past 12 months. He was shot in the head and was found with a gunshot wound to the heart.

Lee had an emergency room visit Tuesday and was placed in a medically induced coma. Doctors told him he would be able to walk again.

"That was a miracle to see this happen," said Dr. Jeffrey J. Himmelstein, a neurologist who specializes in brain tumors and cancer.

Himmelstein said Lee had a history of seizures and that the injection was the first time that Lee had been diagnosed with the condition.

Lee had been in and out of the hospital for two weeks.

Himmelstein said Lee's condition is not life-threatening and the injection was in "the best interest of the patient."

The doctor said Lee's last known seizure was the day of his last chemotherapy session.
