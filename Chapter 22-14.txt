Trump's bluntness powered a White House comeback. Now his words are getting him in trouble in court - The Associated Press reported Friday that the president's lawyers have asked a judge to hold a preliminary injunction against his administration's use of executive privilege to block people who call 911 from speaking in public.

Lawyers for the White House have said they are seeking a preliminary injunction against Mr. Trump's use of executive privilege to block people who call 911 from speaking in public, and that he is using a "statute of limitations" that allows him to use the executive power to force his way through federal court.

"The court is making it clear that the president cannot use executive privilege to compel the speaker of the House to respond to his calls," said a White House statement.

The ruling came less than an hours after the Justice Department announced it would appeal its decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The case is now in the hands of the 9th Circuit, which could hear the case.

The 9th Circuit declined to accept the president's request that the appeals court hear oral arguments in the case, which the White House declined to comment on.

The court's decision means that Mr. Trump, who has said he will not recuse himself from this case, has the legal authority to call his own 911 dispatcher to tell him to stop.

"It is not clear that the president has the authority to do that," said Jeffrey F. Schatz, a lawyer for Mr. Ramos, who is representing Mr. Trump in the case.

The 9th Circuit ruled that the president could not compel Mr. Ramos to stop calling 911.
