As we've noted before, the iPhone 17 has been pretty much the same as the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, but all the new goodies that make up that phone look a little better.

The new Pixelation of the iPhone 17 features a much more pronounced, pixelated screen (instead of a more rounded top) and a much more large, wide screen. You can see the Pixelation in action below.
