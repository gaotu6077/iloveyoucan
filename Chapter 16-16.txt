Rupert Murdochâ€™s outlets rarely apologize. The Prince Harry case was different - CNN's reporting on the event did not include the fact that the former prime minister used a private email account to conduct business, as the BBC reported.

So it comes as no shock that Rupert Murdoch told the BBC his company was "not interested in paying Mr. Putin any money" because "we do not want to see what role he plays in Russian politics".

However, in a statement issued after publication, CNN's Peter Hartley said: "The company has made clear its position and position on the matter has never been to deny or distort the facts."

"The BBC News channel's coverage of the Putin scandal and the Russian interference in our election has not been biased.

"We also do not want to see what role Mr. Putin plays in Russian politics.

"We will continue to follow the story and we will continue to support the BBC.

"We will work closely with our partners and partners around the world as we attempt to work out the best course of action."

Worst case scenario

The US presidential election, which occurred on Monday, was not the first time Putin has been accused of interfering in a US presidential election.

However, as the Kremlin has continued to attack news organisations, the US government has not been prepared to take any action against Putin himself.

In March, former US President Barack Obama accused Putin of interfering in the US election, and it became a major issue when two US senators argued that the Russian president did not have to disclose his email address.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has issued a statement saying: "We have been following the issue and we are still working with the Russian authorities to find a solution.

"The Kremlin is not happy about the US reporting," the ministry added.
