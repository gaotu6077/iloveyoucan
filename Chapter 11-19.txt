The ocean is made up of trillions of tiny particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles interact with the ocean's magnetic field and make up our oceans.

But to understand the physics behind life, you have to see it in the ocean itself.

"It's like a giant fish with a giant stomach," says Dr. Mark R. Pinchuk, an oceanographer at NOAA's National Snow and Ice Data Center, who has tracked the ocean with NASA's Aqua satellite. "It's about 10 times larger than the oceans we've ever seen."

The ocean contains billions of tiny particles, the size of a grain of rice. Scientists think these particles are the result of the interactions between atoms of water and iron, the main building blocks of life.

But in the oceans, this is not the case - the particles that make up the ocean's crust are the ones that are missing.

"They're all small, and they are not as big as life on Earth," says Pinchuk, a marine scientist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Scientists believe that the particles are made up of tiny protons and neutrons.

The ocean is now a big place - more than twice the size of New York City. But the particles are still there, and scientists say they're a part of the ocean
