History Made As Webb Telescope Finds 44 Stars Near Big Bang — Here’s How It Did It - Forbes

The Hubble Space Telescope has uncovered 44 new stars that astronomers believe are "habitable" planets around the core of our galaxy, a discovery that will help astronomers figure out if these small planets can support life.

"The discovery is important because it shows that there are still many unanswered questions about how these planets form," said James White, a professor at the University of California, San Diego and lead author of the study. "If we can find them, we can really help answer the question of if they are habitable."

Habitat and chemistry

The finding comes only weeks after the Hubble Space Telescope launched in March 2011 and, as a result, the world's first space telescope, the Large Hadron Collider. The probe has seen far fewer stars than Hubble can catch.

The Hubble Space Telescope has the most powerful telescope in the world, and the team has found 4,000 new planets within the last six years.

The findings, published in the journal Science, are the first to date to reveal that these planets are likely rocky and rocky-like, with the most likely being formed by the core of a star. The researchers also detected an unusual feature known as a "habitable" planet, and the discovery is the first to point its telescope at a very small planet.

"We found a new planet that is habitable in our galaxy," White said. "We think there is a lot more to this finding than other possible candidates for life in the universe."

The star is a star just six light-years across, which is the distance from the center of our galaxy's red dwarf star to the nearest star system. The star is located in the constellation of Sagittarius, and the discovery indicates a planet formed over 300,000 years ago, about as old as
