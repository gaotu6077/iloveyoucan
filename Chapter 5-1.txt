New Superconductive Materials Have Just Been Discovered - WIRED.com, November 20, 2001

In my book, Superconductivity (and its many variations), I describe how superconductors can be used to conduct electricity (and other electrical phenomena) in a way that is far and away the most advanced and advanced in the world.
