Lawyers for man charged in Kavanaugh assassination plot want evidence tossed - The Washington Post

A judge has ruled that the FBI is required to investigate whether the man who shot President Trump's top aides in the Oval Office was a Russian agent.

The court documents are expected to be heard by the judge in the coming days.

The FBI is seeking information about the man on Thursday, after he was seen walking past a crowd of supporters in the lobby of the White House, officials said.

Prosecutors said the man had been seen by one of his associates and had been in the White House for several hours.

The man had reportedly been seen before taking a picture of the president with a Russian flag.

The FBI says it has no evidence that the man is the Russian agent.

The man has been taken into custody in New York, where he is being held without bond.

He is due back in court on Feb. 10.

The FBI has not said whether the man was a Russian agent.

A White House official said the man's motives were unclear.

President Trump is expected to meet with the FBI director on Feb. 10, the official said.
