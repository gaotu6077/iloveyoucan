Jeff Bezos to Tie the Knot With Lauren Sanchez in $600 Million Wedding Next Weekend - The Daily Beast

"He's also been a big fan of the [New] Age movement, which believes that God has created the world so that we can be in it together, and that we are all part of a global community," he told the Daily Beast.

"And I think that's what we're really looking forward to this year."

The billionaire also said he's been trying to find a way to bring more people from the LGBTQ community to him.

"I'm doing a lot of research and trying to find a way to make sure that people have a place with me, even if I'm not a part of it," he told the Daily Beast. "I know that I'm a big believer in the notion that there's no 'right answer' to every problem, that there's no 'right answer' to every problem. I know that I've done a lot of research and I know that I've been very fortunate to be in the process of finding a solution to a problem that's always been there."

However, the billionaire said he's not sure he'll be able to meet the demand for his wife's wedding on time.

"I think it's going to be a year and a half at least, so I don't think you'll see the wedding soon enough," he said. "I think I've really seen a lot of negativity on social media, I think I've seen people tell me the same thing over and over again.

"But I'll be happy to continue writing about it."

The Daily Beast reached out to the founder of the group, who declined to be named, and a representative for the couple would not give further comment.
