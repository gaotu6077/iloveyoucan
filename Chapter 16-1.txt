Democrat Jared Golden's only tariff fear: That Trump will back down - Axios.

But let's not forget the fact that Trump has never said anything that would stop him from doing what he's doing - signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

He's a man who has been so far from being successful that he's almost literally sitting on top of a mountain. On Saturday, he actually stood down after a day of campaigning.

If this sounds like a huge deal for Trump, it is. Trump has been on a roll for the past week, and he has a big lead over Clinton on the Electoral College.

If he wins the Electoral College, Trump will have only his 1.8 percent of the popular vote, and that could lead him to win the White House.

And if he loses the Electoral College, he's going to lose the White House to Clinton.

The real problem for Trump is that his approval rating is down by about 15 points over the past week. The pollster Nate Silver pointed out last week that Trump is going to have an even stronger lead over Clinton if he wins the White House.

And that will be for a lot of reasons.

Because of the fact that he's been so far behind Clinton in the polls, he could easily win the Electoral College.

For instance, if Trump wins the popular vote by about 20 points, and the popular vote is down by about 30 points, the Electoral College will have won by about 2.5 million votes. That's a lot of votes for a Democratic candidate.

But if Trump wins the Electoral College by about 6.5 million votes, he will be the nominee.

So if Trump wins the Electoral College, he's going to have a much better chance of winning the presidency than if he loses it. And that's the real problem for Trump.

And for all of Trump's claims about winning the presidency, the fact is that the fact that he's winning the popular vote is really just an excuse for him to be so
