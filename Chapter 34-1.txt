Australian woman charged with poisoning 1-year-old girl, posting videos for donations, police say - CBS News

A 21-year-old man with a history of mental illness was arrested on the murder charge in connection to the incident on Saturday afternoon and charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

The victim, who was in critical condition at her home in North Arlington, Virginia, was found by an Army Ranger with a gunshot wound to her head and was pronounced dead at the hospital, according to the Washington Post.

Police say the 18-year-old victim is suspected to have used her gun to kill the girl when she was just 11 years old, according to the Post.

The Army Ranger was stationed in North Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Arlington, when he was called to the scene by a man who said he wanted to make sure the girl was ok. He asked the man to call a local hospital.

The Army Ranger reportedly told the man that if he did not respond within a few minutes, he would kill the girl, according to the Post.

When the man returned home, the girl was found unconscious in the bathroom of a nearby house, and was taken to a hospital.

The Army Ranger was not available
