MLB Insider Cites ‘Major Questions’ For Red Sox After Reported Alex Bregman Deal - NESN 6/23/90

Red Sox closer Alex Bregman has reportedly returned to the team and is scheduled to appear at the New York Yankees on Friday night.

Bregman, 24, made his Major League debut for the Yankees in September 2004 and is currently on the disabled list with a right shoulder injury. His last major league appearance came in August 2010 when he went 3-for-4 with a walk and a strikeout in a 4-2 win over the New York Mets.

Red Sox manager John Farrell has said he does not think the trade will happen. However, manager Terry Francona indicated he would like to see Bregman in the bullpen and not in the bullpen with the Yankees.

Bregman said: "It's just going to be up to the Yankees to make that decision. If it is, that's for sure."
