Trump tariffs live updates: EU matches Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs kicking in - Yahoo Finance

The latest tariffs are expected to bring in some 1.2 million jobs.

Mr Trump's tariffs are to be phased in over six months and will start in June.

The US is also expected to pay a $5.2bn (Â£4.9bn) fine for the damage caused to the US offshoring programme the Obama administration started in 2009.

The US is also expected to pay a $1.5bn fine for its plans to cut the cost of defence by 15%.

The US tariffs on imports of goods are to be triggered, which could trigger a trade war.

The tariffs could also bring in a further $4bn worth of goods, the US president's official website said.

In a separate statement, the US Trade Representative's office said it was "frustrated" by the tariffs.
