US intelligence agencies will now be allowed to assess the strength of Russian military preparations for war with North Korea, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

A senior US official said on Tuesday that the US was now considering whether to launch a strike against North Korea, at a time when China has suspended its involvement in the conflict.

The US is currently considering the possibility of launching a strike against one of its main nuclear powers, North Korea.

The US will now be able to assess the strength of Russian military preparations for war with North Korea, the Pentagon said.

The announcement comes after the US military announced on Tuesday it was launching a joint US-led anti-missile system in the Korean peninsula, which it said would be deployed in support of US forces in South Korea as well as to reinforce US-South Korean strategic security cooperation.

The move is expected to further bolster US-South Korean cooperation on North Korea.
