"Not negotiable": Panama's president hits back at Trump over canal threat - Axios

"But the idea is that, if you have the canal, then you could have a big earthquake in Panama." - Trump on Panama canal's "sophisticated" construction - Axios

Trump's tweet about the canal has been mocked by his own supporters, who have also been criticizing Trump in their own news outlets.

The New York Times reported that former Mexican President Vicente Fox has called the canal "a disaster."

"Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, is right, but it's more like an earthquake," Fox said. "So, we're going to get it."

Trump has also been criticized for his ties to the Panama Canal Authority.

"We've got to pay for the canal," Trump said during a recent speech at a construction company. "We're going to pay for the canal. We don't have to pay for the canal. We have to pay for the canal. We have to pay for the canal. And I have to pay for the canal. It's the biggest canal in the world. And the canal is going to go."
