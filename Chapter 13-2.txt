Trump's FCC commissioner opens investigation into Walt Disney Co. and ABC for diversity policies - The Associated Press


FCC Commissioner Scott Wheeler opened a criminal investigation into allegations that Fox News executives intentionally promoted his network by telling him they were "working on bringing back the news."


The commission will also look into whether the network has been discriminating against LGBT people or that it has discriminated against minorities.


Wheeler is expected to issue a final report by the end of March about the findings.


In 2012, when the commission approved the controversial regulations, Fox News was required to report on race and gender discrimination in the workforce.


The network has since been under fire for its anti-LGBT practices.


The commission has said it has taken steps to address discrimination, including a $1.1 billion settlement with Fox for breaking its anti-discrimination policy.


In January, the FCC announced that it will no longer require that it publish a report on discrimination. Instead, Wheeler is expected to issue a final report.


The investigation into the network's coverage of the 2012 election is expected to start later this year.
