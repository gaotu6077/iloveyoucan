Fatal beating of Black inmate in New York draws probes, outrage - Axios

The man accused of beating a mentally ill inmate at an Albany jail has been charged in a series of shootings and several other shootings of black inmates in Albany, New York.

The alleged gunman, who was booked into a New York City hospital for unrelated injuries, has been charged with a variety of charges, according to New York police.

The attack happened late Friday when a 26-year-old black man was beaten with a hammer and kicked by a white inmate. The man was stabbed several times with a machetes and beaten with a baseball bat before being taken to the hospital where he died.

In a statement released by the state's attorney's office, state police said the incident stemmed from a "hate crime."

The statement said the man "repeatedly and repeatedly assaulted the victim while he was on his way to the hospital."

The man was later shot in the head and taken to the hospital. A witness said the man suffered a gunshot wound to the head.

The attack happened as a group of inmates were being held in a cell block for being on lockdown.

Witnesses told dispatchers that the man was shouting at the inmates.

The man and the group arrived at the hospital and began beating the prisoners. The man fled to a nearby car and was subsequently shot.

The man was taken to the hospital by ambulance, according to the statement. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The man is being held without bond, police said.

New York City Police Department spokeswoman Const. Jessica Miller said about 10 people were at the jail at the time of the attack and there were no reports of any violence.

The attack occurred after an altercation broke out between two black inmates and another inmate at the jail, Miller said.

The man was taken to a nearby hospital and died in the hospital, Miller said.
