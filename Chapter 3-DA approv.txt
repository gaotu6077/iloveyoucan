FDA approves weight-loss drug Zepbound to treat sleep apnea - The Washington Post

Doctors say the FDA can't tell a patient how much they should take in order to avoid being diagnosed with a sleep apnea.

FDA officials say they have no idea how much, or where, the drug should be taken.

The FDA is also waiting to see how many people can get the drug before making a decision on whether or not to pursue a case, said Jessica Fierro, a spokeswoman for the agency.

At least 15,000 people have sought out the drug this year because of severe sleep apnea, which affects about 2 in 5 Americans and affects nearly 40 percent of people in the United States.

It has been used for more than 50 years, and its use is known to cause sleep apnea, the most common cause of death among people with sleep apnea.

Last year, the FDA approved a product called an anti-sleep drug, Zepbound. The FDA didn't know how much Zepbound should be taken, and it didn't want to know why.
