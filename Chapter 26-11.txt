Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa's dog likely died of dehydration and starvation, report says - The Associated Press.

The dog had been living in the area for a half-decade, but had been abandoned by her owners, who she had been looking for.

The dog had been abandoned by her owners for her own safety, the AP reports.

The dogs were found dead in the backyard, which has been closed off to the public since July, the AP reports.

The dogs had been found dead in a rural area near the city of Cheyenne, about 45 miles (68 kilometers) northeast of Cheyenne, according to the Cheyenne Police Department.

A few hours after the dogs were found, the Cheyenne Police Department told the AP that it had received a tip that the dogs had been abandoned, but it had not contacted the police.

"The Cheyenne Police Department is investigating every single incident that has occurred in our community," police spokeswoman Kelly Fong said in a statement.

"They have been unable to locate anyone who might have been displaced due to the weather forecast," she said.

The Cheyenne Police Department is working to determine the cause of the dogs' death, and will provide updates when local officials respond.

The report also said that the dogs had been "exceedingly healthy," including a "nose condition," a "stomach disease," and a "vomiting condition."
