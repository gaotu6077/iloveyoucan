A couple of hundred feet higher than the Great Salt Lake City's tallest building, the Salt Lake City Bridge is expected to raise $50 million to build the $35 million Central Valley Railroad, with the goal of connecting the city to the Pacific Northwest.

The $35 million plan is expected to open on Friday, June 23, with the completion of construction set for the end of June or early July.

The bridge is designed to help the city's two major transportation, rail and road networks link their parts, and to provide a major connection to the Pacific Northwest.

The $35 million project, funded by the public, will build on the $3 billion in public funds that were allotted during the construction of the Central Valley Railroad in 2002, which was completed in the 1950s.

The bridge is expected to provide a 1,100-foot (460-meter) platform with a six-foot (5.5-meter) span that connects the San Juan Valley and the Northern California coast.

"This is a very important project for the city of Salt Lake City," said Chris Williams, the city's general manager for the Central Valley Railroad. "It's going to cost $5 million, and it will be a huge deal for the city."

Williams says the project is a long way from being finished, but it shows how important the project is.

"It's a huge project, and it's going to take time," he said. "If you look at our road network, there's been a lot of road construction in the past, but now we're finally going to have a bridge that's going to connect the city."

In the meantime, the bridge will also include a parking ramp between the bridges.

"The bridge will help us connect to the Pacific Northwest and to more places that are closer to us," Williams said. "That's why we're so excited to have it built."

The project will also be the first of its kind to use public money to build a bridge over a river.
