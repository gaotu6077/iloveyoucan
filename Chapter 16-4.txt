ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE AND UNITED STATES DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE - The White House on Wednesday announced an effort to raise $1 billion from private equity firms to expand existing financial institutions to deal with emerging markets.

The White House said the $1 billion will provide capital to create more than 3,400 new financial institutions and help finance new businesses and investments.

The initiative, announced by President Barack Obama in response to the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., and the subsequent national and international response, will spur investment in emerging markets.

"Today, we will be one step closer to achieving our goal of creating a wealth of high-quality, safe, and secure financial institutions that can compete in the global marketplace," said Obama. "We are committed to making sure those institutions become the envy of the world."

The White House said the funding would be available for about two dozen more new institutions, and the money would be available to more than 5,000 existing banks, financial institutions, and investment banks.

"In addition to financing new businesses, we will also support development of existing banks through the creation of new investment banks that will serve as leverage for new, emerging markets," the White House said.

The administration announced the new investment banks in a statement following the shootings.

"What we're doing is investing in the economy, on infrastructure, and on education. This is a long-term commitment, and we're committed to making sure that every American has the opportunity to get the opportunity they need to grow and thrive," Obama said.

"This is a national effort to create a wealth of high-quality, safe, and secure financial institutions that can compete in the global marketplace."

The investments include the issuance of $17 billion in bonds and $1 billion in capital and $3 billion in capital projects, according to the White
