"You won't find the "Big Bang" in the universe, but it's certainly more like the "Big Bang" in science fiction," says Stephen Hawking.

"In fact, it's so much more than that," says Hawking.

"And if you look at the picture of the universe in the video game universe, that's actually not the Big Bang. It's not a Big Bang. It's the universe in which all the stars were formed. That's how the universe got started."

The Big Bang is the largest ever observed, but it's not the only one.

"There are lots of other large bodies in the universe," says Hawking. "And there are plenty of them as well. A lot of them are supermassive black holes."
